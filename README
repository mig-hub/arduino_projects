ARDUINO PROJECTS

Just a couple of Arduino beginers projects i've made.
Nothing ground-breaking but always interesting.

One is a mini keyboard, and the other one is some kind of theremin, but working with light.
I don't have time now but i'll comment them more as soon as possible.
And put more info...
